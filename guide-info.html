                <section class="mb-5">
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Guide Ahead puts the spotlight on Laterano for the first time and tells a story about Mostima, Fiammetta, and other members of the Notarial Hall having a mission concerning a little girl that would soon embroil into a conspiracy amidst an international conference held by the Lateran Church in the year 1099. It also reveals the reason for Mostima becoming a "fallen" Sankta.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">15 March 1099, three days before the Summit of Nations. The Lateran City is ready for this moment in history. For the past thirty years, Laterano has been sending out their Legati across Terra as peacekeepers and envoys between nations. To commemorate its institutionalization, the Summit will be held at the Pope's Basilica where nations of Terra will discuss worldwide security. Even though only a handful of envoys and representatives arrive at the Summit, the current Pope Yvangelista XI is grateful to see some willingness among the nations.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">And of course, being its Messengers, Mostima the "fallen" Sankta and her supervisor Fiammetta have returned to Laterano. After years of wandering around Terra, the two could finally enjoy their serene hometown. There they also pay a visit to Lemuel's sister Lemuen who is currently undergoing therapy. They are happy to see Lemuen recovering ever since the tragedy in Kazdel eight years ago that led to her coma and Mostima's "fall".</p>
                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Angels and Demons</h2>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Along the way, Cecelia accidentally bumps into Ezell Pastore, an apprentice of the Notarial Hall. The girl suddenly falls into unconsciousness. Ezell quickly brings her to the hospital, only waiting to find something strange on her. Cecelia has fragmented halo and wings, and these puzzle Ezell since she is still exempted from the punishment of the "fallen". At the same time, he notices that the hospital personnel are trying to separate the two and take Cecelia away. Nevertheless, as a kindhearted executor, Ezell promises Cecelia to protect her and find her mother.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">By the time Ezell arrives at Cecelia's home, he realizes things have become more complicated. From starter, Cecelia does not know her mother's death due to her age. Secondly, Cecelia is actually a hybrid, something that should not happen according to the "Law". Worst of all, she has the blood of a Sarkaz, a great taboo in Laterano. Her status makes her a wanted target by both the Church led by Fiammetta, Cardinal Velliv, and Federico the Executor and the "Pathfinders", a Lateranian multi-racial reformist sect. Regardless of the obstacles, Ezell brings Cecelia to the Ecclesia Requietum while defying the Church's order, wishing to let the little girl having her last moment with her mother.</p>
