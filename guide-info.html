                        Guide Ahead puts the spotlight on Laterano for the first time and
                        tells a story about Mostima, Fiammetta, and other members of the
                        Notarial Hall having a mission concerning a little girl that would
                        soon embroil into a conspiracy amidst an international conference
                        held by the Lateran Church in the year 1099. It also reveals the
                        reason for Mostima becoming a "fallen" Sankta.

                        15 March 1099, three days before the Summit of Nations. The
                        Lateran City is ready for this moment in history. For the past
                        thirty years, Laterano has been sending out their Legati across
                        Terra as peacekeepers and envoys between nations. To commemorate
                        its institutionalization, the Summit will be held at the Pope's
                        Basilica where nations of Terra will discuss worldwide security.
                        Even though only a handful of envoys and representatives arrive at
                        the Summit, the current Pope Yvangelista XI is grateful to see
                        some willingness among the nations.

                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        And of course, being its Messengers, Mostima the "fallen" Sankta
                        and her supervisor Fiammetta have returned to Laterano. After
                        years of wandering around Terra, the two could finally enjoy their
                        serene hometown. There they also pay a visit to Lemuel's sister
                        Lemuen who is currently undergoing therapy. They are happy to see
                        Lemuen recovering ever since the tragedy in Kazdel eight years ago
                        that led to her coma and Mostima's "fall".

                        Along the way, Cecelia accidentally bumps into Ezell Pastore, an
                        apprentice of the Notarial Hall. The girl suddenly falls into
                        unconsciousness. Ezell quickly brings her to the hospital, only
                        waiting to find something strange on her. Cecelia has fragmented
                        halo and wings, and these puzzle Ezell since she is still exempted
                        from the punishment of the "fallen". At the same time, he notices
                        that the hospital personnel are trying to separate the two and
                        take Cecelia away. Nevertheless, as a kindhearted executor, Ezell
                        promises Cecelia to protect her and find her mother.

                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        By the time Ezell arrives at Cecelia's home, he realizes things
                        have become more complicated. From starter, Cecelia does not know
                        her mother's death due to her age. Secondly, Cecelia is actually a
                        hybrid, something that should not happen according to the "Law".
                        Worst of all, she has the blood of a Sarkaz, a great taboo in
                        Laterano. Her status makes her a wanted target by both the Church
                        led by Fiammetta, Cardinal Velliv, and Federico the Executor and
                        the "Pathfinders", a Lateranian multi-racial reformist sect.
                        Regardless of the obstacles, Ezell brings Cecelia to the Ecclesia
                        Requietum while defying the Church's order, wishing to let the
                        little girl having her last moment with her mother.
